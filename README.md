# Classic Category Learning Experiment

This repository contains a prototypical, binary cl-experiment - implemented in _magpie.

Basically, it's an adaptation of _magpie's default "2-alternatives forced-choice" template with the following changes:

- trials won't continue automatically, but a 'next' button will show after a choice has been made
- after choosing, the choice will be 'locked in'; that is, participants won't be able to change their decision
- a feedback message will inform participants if their choice was correct and choice-buttons get colored respectively
